	  Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming
	  to be useful for system administrators and travellers, who
	  need to work with lots of remote computers in front of either
	  large monitors or tiny netbooks.

	  Remmina supports multiple network protocols in an integrated
	  and consistent user interface.

	  Currently RDP, VNC, NX, XDMCP and SSH are supported.
